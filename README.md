# 👋 Hey there, I’m @ByteCrafft

- 👀 I’m interested in low-level programming, creative tooling, game dev, and building open-source utilities
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about compilers, OS internals, and clean software architecture
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on minimal, elegant CLI tools and experimental projects in C, Rust, or Python
- 📫 How to reach me: drop a message via Issues or find me at `bytecrafft [at] pm.me`
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy recreating classic tools with a modern twist (like rewriting `cat` with emoji output 😼)
